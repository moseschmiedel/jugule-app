# JuGuLe-App

This is an app for our local youth group. 
We believe in the 3in1 God = Jesus, Father and Holy Spirit and that what is written in the Holy Bible.
Our name is JuGuLe and we are based in Leipzig, Germany in Jacobstra√üe 19.
We are a group of christians who meet every friday from 19.00 to 22.00 to praise our God, hear an input about God, talk and play games together.
Through this app, we can share our next events and activities.
We are open for everyone, so if your interested check us out!
